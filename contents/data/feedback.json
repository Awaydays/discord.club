    "message": "The Embed Generator bot is really good. I love not having to go to a website that I usually go to that has the Discord rich embed JSON code and then having to send it through Postman. Such a hassle. This bot makes it ten times easier. Also for Xenon that's a really unique bot as well. The ability to copy MOST things from one server to another is fabulous."

    "message": "Xenon is amazing but I think it should be able to escape special mentions such as roles and @everyone when loading messages as it can cause you to be pinged a bunch (maybe also add an option to escape all mentions as well as they get spammy)."

It also doesn't seem to copy the afk and welcome channels. (don't know if it's possible) Thank you so much for making Xenon, cheers."

    "message": "I have been around discord for quiet some time. What i think your doing here with Xenon and Embed Generator is amazing. Though i don't believe people should be able to just jumb on your server and grab a template, you could offer them as a sort of reward system. Though that in its self makes your job that much harder. Overall great bots though the embed generator in my own opinion needs a bit of updating."
